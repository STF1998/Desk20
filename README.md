<h2 align="center"> Solving procrastination and raising awareness for water scarcity one glass at a time! </h2>

## Our Product

Flocus is a single-page application (SPA) that aims to combat procrastination from university students studying on devices while raising awareness for the critical world issue of water scarcity. Our application uses a visual aid of a glass filling up as students work following the principles of the Pomodoro technique of a study interval followed by a break. In this break, users will have the opportunity to learn more about water scarcity and Asaqua, a charity that is working to improve water scarcity in Africa.

The application will display how much work their friends have completed to further encourage good studying practices, thus improving overall productivity, and increasing use of our web application. 

Our aim is simple: combat procrastination and raise awareness for water scarcity one glass at a time!

## Our Target Market

When designing Flocus, we had two goals: to help students (like ourselves) reduce procrastination and raise awareness for a critical world issue. Many of the current interval times for students were focused on a clock timer. However, after initial informal focus groups and interviews with friends and peers, we identified that animations would be more suitable and more enticing to use given its novelty compared to a clock timer. Our application provides users with a useful but easy on the eye animation for a study interval while raising awareness for a key issue: water scarcity in underdeveloped nations. 

## Who are we passing Flocus onto?

### ASAQUA

ASAQUA is dedicated to solving the water crisis in underdeveloped countries by offering an affordable rainwater harvesting solution. We believe our water tanks can facilitate clean water accessibility in rural villages.  ASAQUA collaborates with committed locals, NGOs (Non-Governmental Organisations), and research institutes and strives for a sustainable future for our next generation.

Their vision is a world where no child has to trudge miles every day to fetch water, and every individual has the access to clean water.

While we have been working on this project it was great to learn more about the work Asaqua does in developing nations. This understanding further motivated the team to create a product to the best of our ability given the meaningful impact it could have on both procrastination and helping raise awareness for the work Asaqua does. 

Please see below a recent photo of the work Asaqua has been doing in Africa:

We are extremely fortunate to have received a message from the ASAQUA team on the completion of our project:

“We would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to Flocus who have been working with us to raise awareness for the water scarcity crisis that 1/3 of the global population are currently facing. The Flocus team shares the same values as us and has provided a fantastic opportunity for ASAQUA to build awareness and potential ad revenues - we are looking forward to taking over the Flocus project in the future. The cooperation between Asaqua and Flocus demonstrates a novel charity model where users can create a social impact digitally. Thank you team Flocus!”
