## Group Working Methods

### Overview

When developing a single page application, it is critical to consider development methodology, particularly given the large number of moving parts associated with full-stack development. When discussing the development stage, we discussed the pros and cons of an agile vs waterfall methodology before agreeing on the agile approach. The waterfall approach is focused more on a rigid structure of tasks that lead to a final product whereas an agile approach prioritises a more flexible and iterative process to software development. To learn more about development methodologies, please check out this [link](https://www.wrike.com/project-management-guide/methodologies/) that we found very useful.

Check out the Figure 1 below that helps explain the difference in the methodology approaches (Source: [link](https://saigontechnology.com/blog/agile-vs-waterfall-in-software-development)).

### Agile methodology

We focused on an agile methodology that allowed for an iterative and flexible process as well as a greater focus on user interaction. An agile methodology allowed us to effectively and efficiently respond to adversity and challenges throughout the project. One aspect we really enjoyed, as a team, was the iterative aspect and opportunity to provide ideas on improvement from a wide range of perspectives. This led to a better and improved application after each development sprint. 

When approaching the development stage, we were naturally developing a plan around the SCRUM framework. While there are multiple frameworks that come under the agile methodology, the SCRUM framework suited this project because it provided the development team with a flexible and iterative process but gave each individual deadlines and targets to hit, something critical given the current climate of working from home. Each individual in the team had their role and targets but also had a strong understanding of what other team members were doing. This approach allowed us to focus on quality with the flexibility to change priorities as a team when challenges occurred or we wanted to focus on a specific area before moving onto the next.

Initially, as a team we sat down (albeit virtually) and wrote a list of the key features and components that we wanted FLOCUS to include. We finalised our user personas and basic wireframes, which can be seen here (TODO). The below diagram ([link](https://devcom.com/tech-blog/agile-advantages-for-business/)) is a graphical representation of the cycle of agile development we aimed to follow as a group in the design, development and implementation of our product.

### Communication channels

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our team has been working from home throughout the project. This meant that our communication and the channels we used were key to ensuring we worked well as a team. The two main channels we used were our Microsoft Teams and Discord. Our Teams group at desk 20 allowed us to organise video calls, share documents and speak to the lecturing team. However, our most commonly used channel was our Discord chat where we regularly had conversations about specific areas of the project as well as organising voice and video calls to discuss specific areas of development. While it was tough initially to bond as a team, these channels did help us get to know each other and become a driving force as we began development sprints.

## Sprints documentation

## Team use of git

Our team created a remote repository on GitHub for collaboration and version control. In our repository, there are mainly the main branch and different personal branches. We use the main branch to maintain our latest production-ready working copy. During the sprints, each of our developers has his personal feature branch, where we make a frequent commit to achieve effective version control during the sprints. Once the newly developed features are ready to merge with the production-ready working copy on the main branch, we either submit a pull request or inform the entire team about the incoming changes. Therefore, all developers can pull from the latest change, review the code and test the latest working copy with Docker.
