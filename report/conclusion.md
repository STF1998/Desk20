# Working practices

## General working practices

Throughout the project, we feel we have worked effectively and efficiently with one another with consistent communication throughout the design, development and evaluation process.

From the beginning, each individual expressed a desire to work in specific areas, one of the reasons we believe we worked well together as a group. Sam took more of a leadership role alongside front-end development with effective management across full-stack development. While initially we were slightly disjointed in the design stage of the project, we came together very well prior to the Easter break to really define our project and vision together for this project. This ensured we were aligned as approached the development stage.

While we may have struggled at times to get everyone in a meeting due to covid restrictions and difference in time zones, we feel our use of alternative technology and creation of discord chats and use of GitHub allowed the group to work effectively regardless of location or time zone. In the key sprints of development, our team had regular weekly meetings at the start of the week to ensure everyoneâ€™s progress and aims for the week were on the same page. If we had any issues throughout the week, we effectively shared queries via the discord chat and Sam hosted regular 1-to-1 talks with team members to ensure they were on track.
