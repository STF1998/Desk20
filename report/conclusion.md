# Working practices

## General working practices

Throughout the project, we feel we have worked effectively and efficiently with one another with consistent communication throughout the design, development and evaluation process.

From the beginning, each individual expressed a desire to work in specific areas, one of the reasons we believe we worked well together as a group. Sam took more of a leadership role alongside front-end development with effective management across full-stack development. While initially we were slightly disjointed in the design stage of the project, we came together very well prior to the Easter break to really define our project and vision together for this project. This ensured we were aligned as approached the development stage.

While we may have struggled at times to get everyone in a meeting due to covid restrictions and difference in time zones, we feel our use of alternative technology and creation of discord chats and use of GitHub allowed the group to work effectively regardless of location or time zone. In the key sprints of development, our team had regular weekly meetings at the start of the week to ensure everyoneâ€™s progress and aims for the week were on the same page. If we had any issues throughout the week, we effectively shared queries via the discord chat and Sam hosted regular 1-to-1 talks with team members to ensure they were on track. 

## Management of issues

Initially, as a team we did struggle with team communication. This was most likely caused by the lack of familarlity with one another and challenging coursework in other modules. However, to improve our relationship as a team we started to meet more regualrly, having short meetings before the Thrusday lab where we would update one another on ideas, progress on the project and day-to-day activities. 

At the start, we found this incredibly useful to get to know one another given the current virutal environemnt we found ourselves in. As we approached the development sprints, these meetings became increibly useful in helping define our project as well as ensuring each member understood all the aspects of Flocus. As we approached sprint development before the Easter break, we started dividing into sub groups with Sam and Hugh focused on the front-end with Jati, Gordon and Tom focused on the back-end. Alongside our weekly meetings on Thursday, these sub groups would meet at the beginning of each week to go over any issues and talk about the work for the upcoming week. 

This worked well, particualrly in the development sprints, allowing sub groups to focus on specific problems and challenges with the Thursday meeting used to ensure everyone was on the same page and discuss prioritised issues. We often built the project in Docker on the Thursday meetings to ensure everything was running as it should with a focus on checking the implementations from the previosu week of development. 

Please see an example below of the Flocus team using a Thursday meeting opportunity to discuss the Facebook login page.

Alonsgide these meetings, the use of discord was key for the management of issues. As seen in the communication channels section, we had different discord sub-channels to discuss specific issues to do with ther sprints. These were increibly useful for sub teams to query issues and then if any required the whole team they would be put into the general channel. Overall, the regular team and sub-team meetings alongside use of discord channels enabled quick resolution of any issues the team came across throughout the project.

## Evaluation of agile techniques used by the team

TODO - Sam

# Project reflection

Overall, as a team we are very proud of Flocus, including the design, development and evaluation of our MVP (minimum viable product).

At the start, we believe we got slightly ahead of ourselves by trying to plan a project idea that had far too many moving parts for a project of this size. However, after a couple of meetings we quickly nailed down the area of focus to procrastination with an aspect of raising awareness for a critical world issue. While the project required only one of these aspects, we believed we could effectively and efficiently design a product that was a procrastination tool but raised awareness for water accessibility, including the theme of water running throughout the whole application.

Due to our big ideas and aspirations as a team,  when we approached discussing the success of our product we slightly struggled due to define whether or not our project was a success. On one side we had created a minimum viable product that functioned effectively with a Facebook Login capability. However, on the other side there were still areas, such as the google ads and portal personlisation, that we still wanted to integrate into the application. Overall, we had been successful in creating an MVP with future potential to help raise funds for ASAQUA and act as a very effective and personlaised procrastination tool.

So while we had not met our personal goals for the product, we had been successful in developing an MVP to be passed onto the development team at ASQUA to further optimise and improve the web application in the near future.

## Evaluation

As mentioned previously, in the future we woould like to see a full user study of interaction with Flocus. Usability is often considered the most essential factor to investigate as part of the evaluative process. Usability can be defined as the ease of using the webpage and fulfilling user's satisfaction. Key aspects to consider when evaluating the usability of Flocus, include:

- learnability
- memorability
- efficiency
- satisfaction 
- errors

Alongside usability, future evaluiative techniques could focus on evaluating aspects of the following:

- Content - accuracy, conciseness, understandability and does it contain key infromation?
- Appearance - page layout, size and font of writing and page flow.
- Interactivity - portal personalisation, feedback and loyalty.
- Functionality - speed, security, browser compatability and web/mobile compatability.

With pre-planned ethical analysis and approval we would have liked to include the following in future evaluative technqiues:

- Comprehensive surveys on different demographics, including a range of students and professionals.
- Focus groups and interviews investigating user flows and specific scenarios when using Flocus.

Due to the nature of interviews, the interviewer is able to ask direct questions about the usability and how users interact with Flocus. Questionairres allow for a more structured data collection. These combined technqiues allow for collection and analysis of diverse qualitative and quantitaive data. 

Other areas to explore for future work:

- Controlled experiments - Flcous team compare users interaction with Flocus and it's close competitiors. 
- Automated usability tools - with further knowledge and experience we would have liked to integrate useful plugins, such as bugsnag and hotjar, and use tools such as USEful to auotmate testing of the usability.
