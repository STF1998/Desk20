## Abstract

### Motivation for the project

<b><p align= "center"> Figure 1: Lucidchart of the initial ideation stage. </p></b>

The team began the project by drafting up ideas around playful ideas and serious world issues, shown by Figure 1. Given limited time and resources, we swiftly aimed to define a simple but effective project idea that solved a critical issue but also had a playful aspect. Having drafted several ideas, we quickly decided to focus on solving an issue that we all understood and had experienced at some point in our academic lives: procrastination. Secondly, after analysing various game ideas, we decided that the most suitable and simple idea would be to create a competitive aspect, based on avoiding procrastination and improving study techniques. 

However, while we had defined the two key aspects required by the project brief, we quickly realised that we could solve a critical issue in procrastination but also raise awareness for an issue slightly further afield: water scarcity in underdeveloped nations. Fortunately, Gordon, one of our team members, founded his own NGO (non-governmental organisation) called ASAQUA that provides affordable solutions to the water crisis in Africa. 

### The problem we aim to solve

Flocus solves two problems identified in the research and ideation stage:

-	The widespread problem of procrastination amongst university students, particularly with an increase of students working on devices accentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

-	Severe lack of awareness for water scarcity in underdeveloped nations.

### High level overview of our project

Flocus is a single-page application (SPA) that aims to combat procrastination for university students while raising awareness for the critical world issue of water scarcity in underdeveloped nations. Our application uses a visual aid of a glass-fill animation as students work. The work schedule follows the principles of the Pomodoro technique, allowing users to work for 25 minutes followed by a short break. In this break, users will have the opportunity to learn more about water scarcity and ASAQUA, a charity that is working to improve water scarcity in underdeveloped nations.

Flocus provides a natural and relaxing study environment whilst also encouraging good study techniques. The league table offers a competitive incentive which should help users reduce procrastination, increase productivity, and continue returning to the site.

## Project Objectives

### High level aims and goals

#### Main goal of the project

Build a MEAN stack single page application with integration of a front-end (using Angular-CLI), including a responsive design, with a Facebook-API to provide a login capability and competitive league table between friends and peers. 

#### High level project aims

- Help solve procrastination in university student populations by providing a visual aid to help students study for a time interval (following the Pomodoro technique). 

- Raise awareness for water scarcity and ASAQUA, an NGO (non-governmental organization) working to solve the water crisis in underdeveloped nations across Africa. 

- Integrate a league table to represent a competitive aspect between friends and peers to encourage competitiveness and work ethic amongst student populations. 

### How are we solving the problems?

To help reduce procrastination in student populations, we are building a single-page application that allows students to use a visual aid of a glass-fill animation as students work for 25 minutes, followed by a break. This has been inspired by the time management method called the Pomodoro technique, which uses intervals to help students work for short periods of time, allowing for a short break as a reward. We have decided to use a visual aid of a glass filling up, so students have a visual representation of their progress and given its link to water given the key message of our web application: 

<br>
<p align = "center">Solving procrastination and water scarcity, one glass at a time!</p>
<br>

While students are working, the google ads section will be generating revenue which, will be donated to Asaqua. Therefore, students not only have the satisfaction of working towards a target but are also rewarded by the fact they are contributing and helping raise funds for a critical issue in water accessibility. It is a win-win scenario for all parties involved. 

To further encourage students to use Flocus, we are integrating a Facebook login to allow students to compete with their friends on how much time they are committing to work and how much they are raising for charity. The competitive nature will further encourage students to increase their productivity while also encouraging users to use the application on future occasions rather than being a one-stop shop. 

### Team checklist

See the following key points that we used as a checklist to keep the team motivated to succeed in this project: 

- Build a working single page application that was both a procrastination tool and raises awareness for water scarcity in underdeveloped nations. 

- Build extensive and attractive animations for the front-end with quick loading pages. 

- Integrate the single page application with Facebook-API for login capability and competitive league table.
