# Abstract

## Motivation for the project

<b><p align= "center">Figure 1: LucidChart of idea creation stage</p></b>

The team begun the project by drafting up ideas around playful ideas and serious world issues, shown by Figure 1. Given limited time and resources we swiftly aimed to define a simple but effective project idea that solved a critical issue but also had a playful aspect. Having drafted several ideas, we quickly decided to focus on solving an issue that we all had an understanding of and had experienced at some point in our lives: procrastination. Secondly, after analysing various game ideas we decided the most suitable and simple idea would be to create a competitive aspect based on avoiding procrastination. 

However, while we had defined the two key aspects required by the project brief, we quickly realised we could solve a critical issue in procrastination but also raise awareness for an issue slightly further afield: water accessibility in developing nations. Fortunately, Gordon, one of our team members, had founded his own NGO called Asaqua that provided affordable solutions to the water crisis in Africa. 

## The problem we aim to solve

FLOCUS solves two problems identified in the research and ideation stage:
-	The serious problem of procrastination amongst students, particularly with an increase of students working on devices accentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
-	Lack of awareness for water accessibility in Africa

## High level overview of our project

From this development of the ideation stage, we came up with FLOCUS, a single webpage application that aims to combat procrastination for students while raising awareness for Asaqua. The single page application will be focused on a simple glass of water filling up from a tap as you work. The glass would fill up every 1hr and then the user is encouraged to take a 5-10 min break to relax from work. The page will include a login through Facebook, which will allow the page to display a table to encourage competitiveness between friends on how much work they are doing without procrastination. We will have a google ads area to raise funds towards Asaqua with a pop up educating on the work Asaqua are doing to combat water accessibility in Africa. 

# Project Objectives

## High level aims and goals

Project goal:
-	Build a MEAN stack web app with effective integration of a single page frontend with a database and Facebook API to provide a login and persistent storage.
-	Build a single-page application that has a responsive design with a customisable time and desktop usability. 

Project aims:
-	Help solve procrastination in student populations by providing a visual aid and a timer rather than just a clock. 
-	Encourage students to take regular breaks with the use of the visual aid and timer with a pop up to read and look at in their break.
-	Raise awareness for water accessibility and Asaqua, a charity working to solve the water crisis in developing nations across Africa.
-	Integrate a table/chart to represent a competition between friends to encourage competitiveness and work ethic amongst student populations.

## How are we solving the problems?

To help reduce procrastination in student populations, we are building a single-page application that allows students to use a visual aid of a glass filling up to help them work for a period of time followed by a break. This has been inspired by the time management method called Pomodoro Technique and the use of intervals to help students work for an interval combined with rewards of a break. We have decided to use a visual aid of a glass filling up so students have a visual representation of their progress and with its link to water given the key message of our web application:

 “Solving water scarcity and procrastination one glass at a time”

While students are working, the google ads section will be generating revenue which will be donated to Asaqua. Therefore, students not only have the satisfaction of working towards a target and rewarded with a break but are also rewarded by the fact they are actually contributing and helping raise funds for an important issue in water accessibility. It is a win-win scenario for all parties involved. 

To further encourage students to use Flocus, we are integrating a Facebook login to allow students to compete with their friends on how much time they are committing to work but also how much they are raising for charity by using our website. The competitive nature will further encourage students to increase their productivity but also return and use the application on future occasions rather than being a one-stop shop.
