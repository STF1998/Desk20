            <p>FLOCUS is a single-page application that aims to combat procrastination from students working on devices amongst friends while raising awareness for the critical world issue of water accessibility. Our application uses a glass filling up as a visual aid as people work following the principles of the Pomodoro technique of an interval for work followed by a break. In this break, users will have the opportunity to learn more about water accessibility and Asaqua, a charity that is working to improve water accessibility in Africa.
            The application will display how much work their friends have done to further encourage good studying practices, thus improving overall productivity and increasing us of our application.
            Our aim is simple: combat procrastination and raise awareness for water accessibility one glass at a time!
